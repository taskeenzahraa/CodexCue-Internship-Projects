Graphic Design Internship Project Brief

This document provides a brief overview of the three graphic design projects I completed during my internship:

Project 1: Logo Design
Project 2: Social Media Post Design
Project 3: Event Flyer Design

Proud to present my first project of logo design as an intern - the "SHEIN" logo! This project was a fantastic learning experience.

In my second project, I had the opportunity to hone my design skills by creating a range of compelling social media content, including a professional jewelry post, an alluring cosmetic product advertisement, and a stylish clothing arrival announcement.

In my third project I dived into the world of event flyers, crafting a captivating design for a piano recital steeped in elegance, alongside a bold and eye-catching flyer for an upcoming clothing exhibition. Excited to keep growing my design skills and bring future events to life visually!
